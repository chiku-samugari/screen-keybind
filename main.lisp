;;;; Screenrc Generator
;;; Nov. 17th 2012, chiku
;;; I decided to implement a mode like vim's normal mode on screen. It requires
;;; me to write too much same codes and thus I decided to write a converter.
;;; There are 3 categories of commands in snormal mode.
;;;
;;;     +. RETAIN : retains in the same mode after the execution of the command.
;;;     +. LEAVE : leave for the state before any key is input to screen.
;;;     +. TRANSIT : move to a different mode after the execution of the command.
;;;
;;; In principal, all these 3 category can be seen as just a variation of TRANSIT
;;; because a RETAIN command move to the same command after the execution and a
;;; LEAVE command move to a non-screen mode, if we call that state as non-screen
;;; mode.
;;;
;;; In order to move from non-screen mode to another mode, we have to use ``bindkey''

;;; This time, I try reader macro. Let me decide the format of settings first.
;;; { and } are preserved for us!

;;; No, I first have to write a program. Reader macro will behave as a coverter

;;; Dirty function. I want to use symbols to provide pieces of screenrc settings.
;;; Some macros will be proveided as outermost interfaces.
;;; But I do not know if any capital letter is used in the setting. As far as I know,
;;; there are not. Thus, downcased SYMBOL-NAME is used. If some capital letter is needed
;;; then please use a string instead of a symbol : "Capitral-LETTEr-OPtioN".
;;;  I considered to utilize READTABLE-CASE slot of readtable, but concluded it is not
;;; useful in this case because it controls the reader -- it controls what happens on
;;; READ time not EVALUATION time.
;;;
;;;     (let ((*readtable* (copy-readtable)))
;;;       (setf (readtable-case *readtable*) :preserve)
;;;       (symbol-name 'foCus))
;;;     -> FOCUS
;;;
;;; This code clearly shows the reason of the rejection. If I want to solve the problem
;;; by modifying the READTABLE-CASE slot, (setf (readtable-case *readtable*) :preserve)
;;; must be evaluated (to say, executed) before READ any use of COMMAND-DESC macro. It is
;;; not comfortable situation because the COMMAND-DESC macro is used by myself in the
;;; implementation of one upper layer, not the outermost layer (that is exposed to the user).
;;; In such case, START-STATE-DESC function must be as follows:
;;;
;;;     (DEFUN START-STATE-DESC (STATE)
;;;       (COMMAND-DESC bind -c (SYMBOL-NAME STATE)))
;;;
;;; The paremeter STATE can be state or so, though.
;;;  The another reason of rejection is the treatment of positive sign symbol: +. Even if I
;;; accept the uncomfortable situation, +1 becomes 1 when it is read. I mean, the use of
;;; READTABLE-CASE slot only solves a portion of the problem. But this function can solve
;;; the situtation.
